## 🪜 How to Continue the Project

Once you're ready to resume development:

### 1. 📦 Dependencies

```bash
npm install framer-motion tsparticles-slim react-tsparticles
```

### 2. ▶️ Start the Local Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Access the app in your browser at:

```

```

---

### 3. ✏️ Edit or Expand Sections

All page files follow this pattern:

```
app/[route]/page.js
```

You can add new ones easily:

app/contact/page.js   # For contact form
app/blog/page.js      # For devotions or technical writing
```

## 📩 Developer Notes (for future LLM or engineer)

* This project runs entirely offline until it's ready for deployment.
* All design decisions prioritize clarity, conversion, and Christ-centered messaging.
* The user prefers **clean Tailwind code**, fast iteration, and gospel-aligned tone.
* Continue any section with responsiveness and animation polish as default.
* Feel free to add integrations like Resend (for emails), MDX (for blog), or Supabase (for auth/forms) if needed.

## 🙏 Vision Statement (to retain in future updates)
